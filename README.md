# UnityPureMVC-ApplicationTemplate

A template repository to get started with a new UnityPureMVC application.

# Installation

Select the 'Use This Template' button above to create a new repository using this as a template.

Submodules are not recursively added to the new repository, so you also need to add these two projects as submodules:

https://github.com/benwager/UnityPureMVC-Core

-> Assets/Source/UnityPureMVC/Core

https://github.com/benwager/UnityPureMVC-Modules-DataLoader

-> Assets/Source/UnityPureMVC/Modules/DataLoader
